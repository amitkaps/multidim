# Multi-Dimensional Data Visualisation

### With Python and R code

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Handling Data Size: n
- For Small Data
- For Medium Data
- For Large Data
- For Big Data

## 3. Handling Dimensions: p
- Coordinate Transforms
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Layers and Interaction

## 4. [One dimension: p = 1](#04)
* Categorical: Bar, Column, Stacked, Polar
* Continuous: Histogram, Frequency Polygon
* Tips & Tricks: Coordinate changes, Scale transforms, Binwidth

## 5. Two Dimensions: p = 2
About: How does one variable compare to another?

* Categorical vs. Categorical: Stacked, Position, Mosaic
* Categorical vs. Continuous: Histogram with colour, Frequency Polygon, Box Plot, Points
* Continuous vs. Continuous: Scatterplot
* Tips & Tricks: Position, Alpha, Jitter, Binning

## 6. Three to Six Dimensions: p < 7
* Multiple Aesthetics - Colour, Shape, Size
* Facetting - Grid, Wrap
* Matrix

## 7. Seven to Ten Dimensions: p < 11
* Parallel Coordinates
* Projections & Tours

## 8. Dimensionality Reduction: p > 3
- Basic Concept
- PCA and LDA
- t-SNE

## 9. Escaping Flatland: p > 3
- Navigation and Dynamic Queries
- Using linking & brushing, Multiple charts
- 3D visualization, projections & tours

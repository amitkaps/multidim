# Multi-Dimensional Data Visualisation

### With Python, Javascript and R code

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Handling Data Size: n

- For Small Data
- For Medium Data
- For Large Data
- For Big Data

## 3. Handling Dimensions: p

- Representations
- Projections
- Interactions

## 4. [One dimension: p = 1](#04)

* Categorical: Bar, Column, Stacked, Polar
* Continuous: Histogram, Frequency Polygon
* Tips & Tricks: Coordinate changes, Scale transforms, Binwidth

## 5. Two Dimensions: p = 2

* Categorical vs. Categorical: Stacked, Position, Mosaic
* Categorical vs. Continuous: Histogram with colour, Frequency Polygon, Box Plot, Points
* Continuous vs. Continuous: Scatterplot
* Tips & Tricks: Position, Alpha, Jitter, Binning

## 6. Three to Six Dimensions: p < 7

* Multiple Aesthetics - Colour, Shape, Size
* Facetting - Grid, Wrap, SPLOM

## 7. Seven to Ten Dimensions: p < 11

- Aggregation: TableLens
- Small Multiples: Facets 
- Alternate Coordinates: Parallel
- Pixel based: Space Filling Curves
- Stacked based: Hierarchical

## 8. Dimensionality Reduction: p > 3

- Basic Concept
- Linear Transformation: PCA, LDA
- Optimization Based: t-SNE
- Manifold Based: IsoMap
- Graph based: Nearest Neighbour
- Neural Nets: Auto-encoder

## 9. Escaping Flatland: p > 3

- Navigation and Dynamic Queries
- Using linking & brushing, Multiple charts
- 3D visualization, projections & tours

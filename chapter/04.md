# One dimension: p = 1

When you want to show a person, you take a picture or try to draw a portrait of them. So what does the portrait of a data variable look like? The portrait of a data variable is its distribution - how the values are spread across. The shape of the distribution is the portrait of the data.


## Show all the data

We should start always by trying to find a way to show all the data in the visualisation. For `continuous` data, this can be achieved by using a single `x` axis to encode the data. 

```vis
title: 
  text: "All Data - Continuous"
width: 600
height: 50
data:
  url: data/indairport.csv
mark:  circle
encoding:
  x:
    field: altitude
    type: quantitative

config:
  mark:
    opacity: 1
```

This works fine when there are few data points and they do not overlap  - like in the quantitative example the data point at the end of the scale. But if the data points overlap, we end up with overplotting - repeatedly plotting multiple data at the same position. We can use three approaches to reduce overplotting, atleast for small datasets.

- Transform scale
- Reduce opacity
- Jitter position


### Transform scale

Since the distribution of data is left-skewed, we can transform from a `linear scale` to a `log scale` to spread the data and reduce the overplotting.

```vis
title: 
  text: All Data - Log Scale
width: 600
height: 50
data:
  url: data/indairport.csv
mark:  circle
encoding:
  x:
    field: altitude
    type: quantitative
    scale: 
      type: log
  size:
    value: 100
config:
  mark:
    opacity: 1
```


### Reduce opacity

By reducing the `opacity` (transparency) of the `mark`, we can start to see the pattern a little more clearly. More darker the mark, more the number of data points that exist there and vice-versa. 

Using the `mark` as `circle`, we can get a *strip plot*.

```vis
title: 
  text: Strip Plot
width: 600
height: 50
data:
  url: data/indairport.csv
mark:  circle
encoding:
  x:
    field: altitude
    type: quantitative
    scale: 
      type: log
  size:
    value: 100
config:
  mark:
    opacity: 0.5
```

Using the `mark` as `tick`, we can get a *rug plot*.

```vis
title: 
  text: "Rug Plot"
width: 600
height: 50
data:
  url: data/indairport.csv
mark:  tick
encoding:
  x:
    field: altitude
    type: quantitative
    scale: 
      type: log
config:
  mark:
    opacity: 0.5
```

### Playing with position

```vis
title: 
  text: "Jitter Plot"
width: 600
height: 50
transform:
- calculate: random()
  as: jitter
data:
  url: data/indairport.csv
mark:  circle
encoding:
  x:
    field: altitude
    type: quantitative
    scale: 
      type: log
  y: 
    field: jitter
    type: quantitative
    scale:
      domain: [-0.2,1.2]
    axis: null
  size:
    value: 100
config:
  mark:
    opacity: 0.5
```

## Categorical Variable

For a categorical variable, the value of the variable represents which category it falls under. Lets take the example of the `cut` variable in the `diamonds` dataset

### Points - All

Lets visualise all the points in the five categories of `cut` by showing them as points. To ensure we can see all the points, it is necessary to jitter them (randomly spread them around the actual point), to visualise all the points.

```vis
width: 400
data:
  url: data/diamonds.csv
mark: point
encoding:
  x:
    field: cut
    type: ordinal
```

So the simplest way to develop a portrait is to count the number of times the variable occurs in each category. Lets take the example of the ```cut``` variable in the ```diamonds``` dataset, and generate a count of occurences by type of cut.

| cut   | Fair    | Good   | Very Good  | Premium  |  Ideal  |
|:------|--------:|-------:|-----------:|---------:|--------:|
| count | 1,610   | 4,906  |  12,082    |  13,791  |  21,551 |

Let us see some examples of how we can visualise this.

### Dot Chart
Lets start by using our mark as points.

```vis
width: 400
height: 400
data:
  url: data/diamonds.csv
mark: bar
encoding:
  x:
    field: cut
    type: ordinal
  y:
    aggregate: count
    field: price
    type: Quantitative
```


### Bar Chart
Then change the mark to bar to get a bar chart.


```vis
width: 400
height: 400
data:
  url: data/diamonds.csv
mark: bar
encoding:
  x:
    field: cut
    type: ordinal
  y:
    aggregate: average
    field: price
    type: quantitative
```


### Column Chart
Flip the cartesian coordinate system to exchange the axis to get a column chart.


    Transform: Count
    Mark: Bar
    Position: Normal  
    Coord: Cartesian - Flip


### CoxComb Chart
Change the coordinate system to polar with mapping the angle to x to get a coxcomb chart.

    Transform: Count
    Mark: Bar   
    Position: Normal  
    Coord: Polar - X


### Stacked Chart
Play with the position of the bars by stacking them to get a stacked chart.

    Transform: Count
    Mark: Bar   
    Position: Stacked  
    Coord: Cartesian


### Bullseye Chart
Change the coordinate system of a stacked chart to polar with mapping angle to x to get a bullseye chart. (Need to keep the width of the stacked bar as 100% to get complete circles)

    Transform: Count
    Mark: Bar   
    Position: Stacked  
    Coord: Polar - x


### Pie Chart
Use a polar coordinate systems but with mapping angle to y to get the familiar pie chart.

    Transform: Count
    Mark: Bar   
    Position: Stacked  
    Coord: Polar - y



## Quantitative Variable

| price | Min.    | 1st Qu | Median   | Mean  |  3rd Qu  | Max.   |
|:------|--------:|-------:|---------:|------:|---------:|-------:|
| $     | 326     | 950    |  2,401   | 3,933 |  5,324   | 18,820 |

### Histogram

    Transform: Bin
    Mark: Bar   
    Position: Normal  
    Coord: Cartesian


### Frequency Polygon
